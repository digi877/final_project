As an aside/note: We referenced the code of the Sparkfun music visualizer when adjusting for volume and color gradients, 
and borrowed elements from it. After multiple attempts to understand the basics of how to work with volume/brightness/color, we 
decided collectively that it would be most efficient to use their existing code as a springboard. This ended up being a very effective
way of getting acquainted early-on with how to program the LEDs; though elements of their code still remain within the program, 
all of the main methods were written by us, and most of them don't actually make use of the color gradients provided.
